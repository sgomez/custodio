# Progress

Each session appends one entry at the bottom. Keep entries short: the next session reads them
with an empty context.

## Sessions

### 2026-10-27 — F01 — 1
- Done: workspace with `custodiod` (lib+bin), `custodio-pkcs11` (cdylib+rlib), `custodio-cli` (bin) under `crates/`; `rust-toolchain.toml` pinned to 1.99.1; `Cargo.lock` committed; `forbid(unsafe_code)` everywhere except pkcs11; pedantic denied workspace-wide, plus unwrap/expect/panic/indexing_slicing in `custodiod`. verify passes.
- Decisions: Cargo cannot mix `lints.workspace = true` with extra lints, so `custodiod` repeats pedantic locally (see docs/decisions.md).
- Not done / known issues: no `justfile` yet.
- Next session should: build the next feature; new crates must set `[lints] workspace = true`.
