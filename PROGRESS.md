# Progress

Each session appends one entry at the bottom. Keep entries short: the next session reads them
with an empty context.

## Sessions

### 2026-11-01 — F63 — attempt 1
- Done: `just e2e-cases <target> <names|globs>...` (shared `e2e-packages` recipe, used by `e2e` too). `e2e/run.sh TARGET --cases NAME...` validates
  names/globs against the target's universe before any engine call and passes the selection as `exec -e E2E_SELECT=ids`; `e2e/select.sh` (new) holds
  `selected`, `case_group`, `phase_runs`; `report.sh` prints nothing for unselected cases; `guest.sh` skips phases no selected case needs
  (journal/unavailable need user; lifecycle needs upgrade, silently); `check-cases.sh check ... [SELECTED]` accounts a subset. The old/old-path
  guest runs only happen when a selected id belongs to them. Refusal-only target: `refusal.sh` reports through `case_run`, so the filter covers it
  (no own assertion needed). Tests: `test-e2e-select.sh` (guest helper, phase decision), `test-e2e-select-host.sh` (host, stub engine; split off
  `test-e2e-host.sh` because of the 5000-token file gate), subset matrix in `test-e2e-skips.sh`. Edited existing assertions only to follow the moved build
  (`test-e2e-host.sh` recipe line, `test-e2e-old.sh` awk now reads `e2e-packages`).
- Real runs: `just e2e-cases debian13 pkcs11-tool-approve-rsa 'nss-*'` exits 0, "4 cases accounted for", log has 4 E2E-CASE lines; `just e2e-cases debian13 no-such-case`
  exits 1 naming the case (after the package build; no container started).
- Not done: the `verify` starts with `just check`, which is red on the untouched tree for two reasons outside F63 (see BLOCKED.md): `scripts/test-docs-install.sh`
  (its precondition greps SPEC.md for "Ubuntu 24.04", which the M3 spec no longer contains) and shellcheck SC2317 infos in `scripts/test-relabel.sh` with the
  dev container's shellcheck. All F63 tests and `just test-changed F63` otherwise pass.
- Next session should: read BLOCKED.md answer, then run `just check` and the verify once.

### 2026-11-01 — F63 — attempt 2
- Done: BLOCKED.md was answered and the precondition/shellcheck issues are fixed upstream (afcb66f, e928564). No code change needed. Ran the verify parts:
  `just test-changed F63` green; `just e2e-cases debian13 pkcs11-tool-approve-rsa 'nss-*'` exits 0 ("4 cases accounted for", 4 E2E-CASE lines);
  `just e2e-cases debian13 no-such-case` exits 1 and names `no-such-case`.
- Not done: nothing.
- Next session should: nothing for F63.
